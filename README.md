# F3 Mail Merge

Faiz's Fully Free Mail Merge (F3 Mail Merge) is a mail-merge tool for Gmail and Google Sheets.

It is freely licensed and will always be completely free to use without any restrictions
(except those imposed by the Gmail API). No one should have to pay a subscription fee
for a tool as simple as mail merge.

## Usage

## Limitations

To ensure that F3 stays free to use forever without creating a maintenance burden, it is subject
to a couple of limitations:
- F3 will not support link-tracking or open-tracking. These features are easy to implement
  but require a server to be maintained. This tool should work forever without any intervention
  on my part.
- F3 does not impose any of its own rate limits, but it is subject to the Gmail API's rate
  limits. Because F3 is designed to work without a server, it also can't keep track of how
  much quota you have left.
- No support or warranty is provided. If you discover a bug, please do file an issue and I
  will endeavor to fix it, but I make no promises.

Other than that, please enjoy using F3 Mail Merge (and your extra $20â€“100/year from not paying
for something else)! If you find it useful, please do share it with your friends and colleagues.
